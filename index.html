  <h3 id="about">ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h3>
  <p class="left">This website reminds you to drink a glass of water at intervals
  that are set by you in the timings division below, which you can navigate to by either scrolling down or clicking on the timings bar on the top navbar</p>

  <h3 id="why">IMPORTANCE OF DRINKING WATER</h3>
  <p>Water keeps every system in the body functioning properly. The Harvard Medical
    School Special Health Report 6-Week Plan for Health Eating notes that water has
    many important jobs, such as: carrying nutrients and oxygen to your cells,
    flushing bacteria from your bladder, aiding digestion, preventing constipation,
    normalizing blood pressure, cushioning joints, protecting organs and tissues,
    regulating body temperature, maintaining electrolyte (sodium) balance.Giving
    your body enough fluids to carry out those tasks means that you're staying
    hydrated.If you don't drink enough water each day, you risk becoming dehydrated.
    Warning signs of dehydration include weakness, low blood pressure, dizziness,
    confusion, or urine that's dark in color.</p>
